The [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) is a brain teaser loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal.  Monty Hall was the show's original host.
This computer model demonstrates that under certain specified conditions switching doors is always more likely to win than sticking with the originally chosen door.  See the [Wilipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) and code comments for details.  One key assumption of this demonstration is that Monty always has to offer the contestant the opportunity to switch doors after the initial door selection, a constraint that did not actually apply on the television show.
